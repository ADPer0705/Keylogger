## Overview

This project implements a keylogging system in C# for **educational and security research purposes only**. It serves as a platform for studying endpoint monitoring techniques, user input tracking, and defensive countermeasures.

## Repository Status Update

This repository was initially non-functional and contained incomplete implementations. It has since been updated to include basic functionality for educational and research purposes. Non-functional components remain in the codebase for future development and study.

## üõ†Ô∏è Key Features

- **Input Monitoring Engine**: Keyboard state monitoring through Windows API hooks
- **Data Processing**: Event formatting with encryption for captured data
- **Anti-Detection**: Environment analysis and stealth techniques
- **Persistence**: Multiple installation methods with clean uninstallation

## üß™ Technology Stack

- **Framework**: .NET Framework 4.8
- **Target Platform**: Windows 10/11
- **IDE**: Visual Studio 2022
