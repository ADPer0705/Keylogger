2. **Memory Forensics**: Techniques for minimizing memory artifacts
3. **Counter-Analysis**: Methods used by security researchers to analyze keyloggers
4. **System Internals**: Deeper understanding of Windows input systems
5. **Defensive Applications**: How this research informs better defenses

## Implementation Principles

All development will adhere to these principles:

- **Educational Value**: Each feature should provide learning opportunities
- **Code Documentation**: Thorough comments explaining security concepts
- **Modularity**: Components should be separable for focused study
- **Testability**: All features should include test vectors
- **Research Focus**: Features prioritized by research value, not operational capability
